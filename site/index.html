			Chicken
		</div>
		<p>
			Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]

The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.[3]

			Beef
		</div>
		<p>
			Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]

Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

			Sushi
		</div>
		<p>
			Sushi is popular around the world, but that doesn't mean everyone understands what this dish technically is. For starters, sushi does not not always mean raw fish. Rather, it's that raw fish - sashimi in Japanese - is the most popular ingredient in sushi.


The term sushi actually refers to foods that use a type of rice seasoned with vinegar and are garnished with raw fish or vegetable. The sushi rolls (maki) that you may be imagining are just one of many types of sushi. It's important to know this before you visit Japan, or you're bound to be confused when visiting a sushi restaurant.


If you're traveling to Japan or just want to learn more about the cuisine, the best thing to do is to read up on the different types of sushi and prepare your taste buds for some true Japanese delicacies.

The Different Types of Sushi
There are several types of sushi, making it an appealing food to people with a wide range of tastes. One form of sushi, nigiri-zushi, are hand-formed mounds of rice with a dab of wasabi topped with various ingredients. Popular nigiri-zushi include maguro (tuna), toro (belly of tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), and ebi (shrimp).


Maki-zushi is the Japanese name for sushi rolls. A sheet of nori (dried seaweed) is layered with sushi rice, and a row of fish and vegetables. The sheet is then tightly rolled with a makisu. After that the roll is sliced into pieces, plated, and served. Rolls such as these are called norimaki. Tekkamaki (tuna rolls) and kappamaki (cucumber rolls) are two common versions.Additionally, inari-zushi are deep-fried tofu pouches stuffed with sushi rice which are brown and oval-shaped, and chirashi-zushi are sushi served on a plate or bowl with different ingredients on top of rice.
